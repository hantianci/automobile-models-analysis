Analysis of 1979 Automobile Models --- Using Linear Models

Identified influencing factors of prices of 66 automobile models in 1979 using several types of linear models in R, such as ridge regression and LASSO; Adjusted models’ parameters based on model diagnostics; Used R package “huge” (High-Dimensional Undirected Graph Estimation) to generate scatter plots to show relative weights of the factors (how different covariates affect each other)
